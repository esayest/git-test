    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I love this lasagna recipe because it combines the comforting flavors of the lasagna I grew up on with the refined taste of a restaurant-style dish. It’s surprisingly easy to make, thanks to oven-ready noodles that save time and effort while delivering a texture that rivals fresh homemade pasta—a definite win!</p>
    The layers are packed with a flavorful meat sauce made with Italian sausage and vegetables, plus four types of cheese. Baked until bubbly and golden, it’s the perfect cozy dish for a crowd—and it reheats and freezes beautifully, too. This lasagna is a longtime family favorite, right alongside other crowd-pleasing dishes like baked ziti, stuffed shells, and manicotti. After all, everyone loves Italian!

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <p><li>Make the Sauce: Place the onions, garlic, carrots, and celery in a food processor. You need to give them a rough chop first, otherwise, they won’t chop evenly. Pulse until minced but not puréed, so that they melt into the sauce. (Alternatively, you can chop by hand.) Minced vegetables in a food processor.</li><br>

        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat, and add the sausage. Cook, breaking the sausage into small pieces, until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a plate with a slotted spoon and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add the remaining tablespoon of olive oil to the pan and add the minced vegetables. Cook until the vegetables are very soft, 6 to 8 minutes. </li>
        <li>Add the wine and continue cooking, stirring to scrape any brown bits from the bottom of the pan, until the wine is mostly absorbed by the vegetables, a few minutes.</li>
        <lI>Add the tomatoes, cream, salt, pepper, sugar, thyme and bay leaves.</lI>
        <li>Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer until the sauce is thickened, about 20 minutes. Add the sausage back to the pot and continue simmering until the sausage is fully cooked and the flavors all meld together, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Make the filling: Combine the ricotta, cream cheese, egg, garlic, Parmesan, salt and pepper in the bowl of a food processor. Process until evenly combined, then add the basil and pulse until finely chopped.</li>
        <li>Assemble: Spread about 1½ cups of sauce in the bottom of the baking dish. Arrange 3 noodles over the sauce, then spread the ricotta mixture evenly over the noodles, and sprinkle with ¾ cup mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>Repeat the layers of sauce, noodles, ricotta filling, and mozzarella twice more. Top with the last 3 noodles, the remaining sauce, mozzarella, and ¼ cup Parmigiano-Reggiano.</li>
        <li>Bake until bubbling and golden, about 1 hour. Remove from the oven and let stand for 15 minutes before serving. Lasagna can be assembled and refrigerated up to 1 day ahead of time or frozen for longer storage.</li>
