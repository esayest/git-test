    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I love this lasagna recipe because it combines the comforting flavors of the lasagna I grew up on with the refined taste of a restaurant-style dish. It’s surprisingly easy to make, thanks to oven-ready noodles that save time and effort while delivering a texture that rivals fresh homemade pasta—a definite win!</p>
    The layers are packed with a flavorful meat sauce made with Italian sausage and vegetables, plus four types of cheese. Baked until bubbly and golden, it’s the perfect cozy dish for a crowd—and it reheats and freezes beautifully, too. This lasagna is a longtime family favorite, right alongside other crowd-pleasing dishes like baked ziti, stuffed shells, and manicotti. After all, everyone loves Italian!
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Onion, Garlic, Carrots, and Celery</li>
        <li>Italian Sausage</li>
        <li>Red Wine</li>
        <li>Egg</li>
        <li>Heavy Cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the Sauce: Place the onions, garlic, carrots, and celery in a food processor. You need to give them a rough chop first, otherwise, they won’t chop evenly. Pulse until minced but not puréed, so that they melt into the sauce. (Alternatively, you can chop by hand.) Minced vegetables in a food processor.</li>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat, and add the sausage. Cook, breaking the sausage into small pieces, until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a plate with a slotted spoon and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add the remaining tablespoon of olive oil to the pan and add the minced vegetables. Cook until the vegetables are very soft, 6 to 8 minutes. </li>
        <li>Add the wine and continue cooking, stirring to scrape any brown bits from the bottom of the pan, until the wine is mostly absorbed by the vegetables, a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Make the filling: Combine the ricotta, cream cheese, egg, garlic, Parmesan, salt and pepper in the bowl of a food processor. Process until evenly combined, then add the basil and pulse until finely chopped.</li>
    </ol>
